    <h2>This is just a little about me, and my Hobbys</h2>

        <p>Hello, my name is Enrique, but i frecuently called Kike for my friends and my family.
            <br />
            I really like flying drones, currently I have 2 drones:
            <ol>
                <li>DJI Mini 3</li>
                <li>DJI Air 3</li>   
            </ol>
           
            The First Drone looks like this: <br />
            <img src="./assets/images/mini3.jpg" alt="DJI Mini 3" height="380"><br />

        
           The second drone that I have looks like this: <br />
           <img src="./assets/images/Air3.jpg" alt="DJI Air 3"  height="255"><br />
        </p>

        <p>
            This how I prettend creat a comerce offering My services like Drone Pilot, maybe some people think this is easy, but not at all 
            specially if you are never flying a drone. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are some of my projects I worked during my practice with HTML 
            I hope this is really simple, but for me, is just the beginning of this journey how Software Developer and <br />
            other things like IA and Phyton.
